<p><h4> All Stories Have a Beginning</h4></p>
<p>Born and raised in Brooklyn, New York, and always having a fascination for music and creativity, I wanted to pursue something combining music and technology, thus I thought to pursue <a href="http://steinhardt.nyu.edu/music/technology">NYU's music technology program</a>. Of course, upon being advised and encouraged that pursuing computer science would be a better choice giving me more career options, I explored and was accepted into the <a href="http://www.pace.edu/seidenberg/">Seidenberg School of Computer Science and Information Systems</a> at Pace University, NYC, where I am currently a sophomore pursuing a combined degree of a Bachelors of Arts in Computer Science and Masters of Science in Information Technology. After completing my first year and halfway through my second, I discovered I had an interest in 3D modeling, animation, and computer graphics and I considered it to be a possible career path.</p><br>
<p><h4>And Then the Discovery</h4></p>
<p>I have always loved Disney and Pixar, and with my growing interest in 3D came a growing want to one day work at Pixar Animation Studios, where all the magic happens. Reading more about the <a href="http://www.pixar.com/about/Our-Story">history and development</a> of
ï¿¼
Pixar and it's graphics and <a href="http://www.pixar.com/about/The-Exhibition">animation</a> has solidified my interest in this company. While I still decide on what I want to use my skills and talents in the future, the <a href="http://www.pixar.com/careers/Available-Internships#Pixar-Internships- TechnicalArtists-945">Pixar Animation Program</a>, which I have come across while looking for available internship and study opportunities is the program just for me! love disney and pixar always. Dreamed of one day working at pixar bringing things to life. Looking through pixar's website, what they do, available internships I could do. Found the PUP, immediate interest. this is the program for me!<br>
<p><h4> What have I done?</h4></p>
<p>Throughout my studies at Pace thus far, I've learned Java, and I have taught myself HTML, CSS, and some JavaScript through <a
href="http://www.codecademy.com/dashboard">Codecademy</a> and <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/">W3Schools</a>. This web page I've constructed here demonstrates some of this. I have also begun teaching myself to use Maya to construct 3D models; more of this can be seen in the tab <a href="mayaProjects.html">"Projects in Maya"</a>. While still a beginner, I have a real interest in these technologies, and Pixar presents an excellent program and opportunity, as well as resources for one interested in such. I also have an interest in photography and in art, which can be seen in the <a href="http://musicalartsymisfit.tumblr.com/">Art</a> and <a href="http://instagram.com/photographize">Photography</a> tabs.<br><br>
