<p><h4>Beginner with Maya? Try the Helmet Construction</h4></p>
<p> The first project I began and completed in the Autodesk Maya program was the construction of a motorcycle helmet. Following a tutorial provided by the makers of Maya in order to get started, the progression of the creation of the helmet is displayed below.</p><br>

<p> Following the reference image provided, half of the helmet model is created. A useful tool provided in Maya Autodesk allows for half of an image to be constructed, then its reflection is copied over the y-axis, which allows for the other half of the object to be perfectly symmetrically constructed.
Upon doing that, the rest of the details of the helmet is created, and the finished product (the low resolution and the smooth resolution mesh) is displayed below.</p><br>

<p><h4>Behold, Ye Olde Castle!</h4></p>
<p> After completing the motorcycle helmet, I embarked upon a slightly more challenging task for a Maya beginner: constructing a castle. While it is still basic, the construction of the castle also included some tests with colours, and the progression of this project is displayed below.</p><br>

<p> This particular construction required a few extra steps. After the crown of the castle was constructed, it needed to be hidden so that the tower can be placed accurately.</p><br>

<p> After the tower is built, it is duplicated using a Maya tool and rotated to each corner of the castle. The crown is then un-hiddden to reveal the completed, but colour-lacking castle.</p><br>

<p>Colour is now added to the castle using the Hypershade feature in Maya.</p><br> <div class="container"><div class="img">

<p>The painting has been finished, and a door is carved into the front of the castle. The different perspectives of the castle are shown along with an x-ray of the core construction.</p><br>
